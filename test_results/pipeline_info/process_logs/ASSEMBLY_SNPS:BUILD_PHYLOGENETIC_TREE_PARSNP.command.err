ML Model: Jukes-Cantor, CAT approximation with 20 rate categories
Initial topology in 0.00 seconds
Refining topology: 8 rounds ME-NNIs, 2 rounds ME-SPRs, 4 rounds ML-NNIs

ML-NNI round 1: LogLk = -7433.231 NNIs 0 max delta 0.00 Time 0.02
Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.688 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
ML-NNI round 2: LogLk = -7213.761 NNIs 0 max delta 0.00 Time 0.03
Turning off heuristics for final round of ML NNIs (converged)
ML-NNI round 3: LogLk = -7213.625 NNIs 0 max delta 0.00 Time 0.04 (final)
Optimize all lengths: LogLk = -7213.625 Time 0.05
