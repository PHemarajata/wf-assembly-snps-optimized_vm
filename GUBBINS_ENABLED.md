# âœ… Gubbins Recombination Detection Enabled

## What Changed

I've enabled **Gubbins** recombination detection in your pipeline by updating the configuration:

**File**: `conf/params.config`
```
recombination = "gubbins"  # Changed from "none"
```

## What is Gubbins?

**Gubbins** (Genealogies Unbiased By recomBinations In Nucleotide Sequences) is a tool for:
- **Detecting recombinant regions** in bacterial genome alignments
- **Removing recombination effects** from phylogenetic analysis
- **Improving phylogenetic accuracy** by masking recombinant positions
- **Providing detailed recombination maps** showing where recombination occurred

## How It Works in Your Pipeline

### 1. **Core Genome Alignment**
- ParSNP creates the initial core genome alignment
- Alignment is converted to FASTA format

### 2. **Gubbins Analysis**
- Gubbins analyzes the alignment to detect recombination
- Identifies recombinant regions across all samples
- Creates a recombination-free phylogenetic tree

### 3. **Position Masking**
- Recombinant positions are masked in the alignment
- Masked alignment is used for final distance calculations
- Final phylogenetic tree is built from masked data

## Output Files

When Gubbins is enabled, you'll get additional outputs:

## Key Benefits

### ðŸŽ¯ **Improved Phylogenetic Accuracy**
- Removes bias from horizontal gene transfer
- More accurate evolutionary relationships
- Better resolution of closely related strains

### ðŸ“Š **Detailed Recombination Analysis**
- Identifies which regions underwent recombination
- Shows recombination frequency per branch
- Provides statistics on recombination events

### ðŸ”¬ **Publication-Quality Results**
- Standard tool in bacterial genomics
- Widely accepted methodology
- Suitable for high-impact publications

## Performance Impact

### **Resource Usage** (on your 64-CPU, 412GB RAM VM):
- **CPU**: Uses `process_high` (24 CPUs per cluster)
- **Memory**: Uses `process_high` (96GB per cluster)
- **Time**: Adds ~30-60 minutes per cluster (depending on size)

### **Cluster Processing Times** (updated estimates):
- **Cluster 1** (264 samples): ~5-6 hours (was ~4 hours)
- **Cluster 2** (76 samples): ~1.5 hours (was ~1 hour)
- **Smaller clusters**: 20-45 minutes each (was 15-30 minutes)
- **Total time**: ~5-6 hours (vs ~4 hours without Gubbins)

## Alternative Recombination Options

You can also choose other recombination detection methods:

### **Option 1: Gubbins Only** (Current Setting)
```bash
--recombination gubbins
```

### **Option 2: ClonalFrameML Only**
```bash
--recombination clonalframeml
```

### **Option 3: Both Methods**
```bash
--recombination both
```

### **Option 4: No Recombination Detection**
```bash
--recombination none
```

## Updated Command

Your command remains the same - Gubbins is now enabled by default:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf \
  -profile gcp_vm \
  --input /path/to/your/fasta/files \
  --poppunk_clusters cluster_analysis_output/poppunk_clusters_min3.csv \
  --min_cluster_size 3 \
  --outdir results_clustered \
  --snp_package parsnp
```

## Interpreting Gubbins Results

### **Recombination Positions File**
- Lists genomic positions identified as recombinant
- Shows which samples are affected
- Provides confidence scores

### **Per-Branch Statistics**
- Recombination frequency per phylogenetic branch
- Number of recombination events
- Length of recombinant regions

### **Masked Alignment**
- Original alignment with recombinant positions masked
- Used for final phylogenetic tree construction
- Provides "clean" evolutionary signal

## Quality Control

Gubbins includes built-in quality control:
- **Convergence checking**: Ensures analysis completed properly
- **Statistics validation**: Verifies recombination detection
- **Output validation**: Confirms all files generated correctly

## Why This Matters for Your Analysis

### **Burkholderia pseudomallei Context**
- B. pseudomallei is known for horizontal gene transfer
- Recombination can confound phylogenetic relationships
- Gubbins will improve accuracy of your cluster-based trees
- Essential for epidemiological and evolutionary studies

### **PopPUNK + Gubbins Combination**
- PopPUNK clusters reduce computational burden
- Gubbins provides high-resolution analysis within clusters
- Best of both worlds: efficiency + accuracy

## âœ… **Summary**

**Gubbins is now enabled** and will:
1. **Detect recombination** in each of your 12 PopPUNK clusters
2. **Improve phylogenetic accuracy** by masking recombinant regions
3. **Provide detailed recombination maps** for each cluster
4. **Generate publication-quality results** with minimal additional runtime

The pipeline is ready to run with enhanced recombination detection capabilities!
